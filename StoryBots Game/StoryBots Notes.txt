Pitch Ideas:
* Interaction allows audience attachment which creates longevity.
* Kids are less and less able to learn without engagement.
* Can use VR interaction.
* Want to tap into every medium available.
* Unity is relatively free to use and deploys to 25+ platforms.
* Already have a skilled team of developers and 3D artists.
* More active product than videos
* Multiple means for revenue (game buys, micro-transactions, product placement)
* Another means to drive new people to the Storybots brand.
* Tied to a show so twice the reach (think Pokemon Go)
* All educational games are 1D (learn the states, riddles, math). Can create a full education game
* Possibility for growth and expansion is endless. (Khan Academy)


Talk Ideas:
* Start with Pokemon (was a show, entered games... became timeless).
