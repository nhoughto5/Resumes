1.) What is 2^8? Why is this number important?
	- 256. It is the value of a byte and the max range of RGB values
	
2.) What is -2 in hex? (Literally just memorize, they don't care if you know how to calculate it)
	-0x2, negative 3 is 0xFD. Take the value, express in binary, flip all bits and add 1. Then convert to hex. 
	
3.) What is the dot product? How does this relate to angles? What is the cross product?
	- The dot product is a scalar which relates to the angle betweem the vectors by P*Q = |P||Q|cos(alpha).
	- The cross product provides a new vector which perpindicular to both of the vectors being multiplied.

4.) Given two vectors, how can you tell what direction the normal is facing?
	- Take the cross product to get a vector which describes the direction of the normal
	
5.) Given a plane, how can you tell which side a point is on?
	-Find the distance along the normal vector, if it is negative it is on the under side.

6.) What is the equation for a plane? 
	- (Ax + By + Cz + D = 0)
	
7.) Give this equation, what does A,B,C represent? How can you tell if a point lies on this plane?
	- A B C represents the normal. Enter the point values into the formula. If it equals 0 then yes it is on the plane.
	
8.) Do you know what a Quaternion is?
	- A 4D vector used to represent a rotation around an arbitrary axis.
	- Represented by {w, q} where q is the axis vector. *Must be a unit vector
	
9.) Do you know what a HashMap is? How do you map a String/Object to a value?
	- Hash map is an implementation of a map collection which uses a hash key value in order to keep access time constant.
	- If same hash, items are stored in a linked list.
	
10.) What is a virtual function?
	 -Virtual functions are methods whose implemntaion can be overridden by a sub-type.

11.) Given a point and a plane, how do you find the distance between the two?
	- Take equation of the plane to find a point on the plane P. (Ax + By + Cz + D = 0)
	- Compute vector F = (Q - P).
	- d = |F|cos(theta)
	- d = |N||F|cos(theta) / |N|
	- d = N * F / |N|
	- d = (Ax + By + Cz - D) / |N|
	
	
12.) Given a point and a plane, how do you find a line that is parallel to the plane that passes through the point?
	
13.) What's the fastest way to tell if 2 signed floats are the same polarity?
