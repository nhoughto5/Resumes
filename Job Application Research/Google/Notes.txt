Mutex vs Semaphore:
	Mutex and semaphores are essentially the same thing. They both lock a resource to prevent threads altering them. Mutexes set a flag to one, decrement it when locking and incrementing when unlocking. Sempahores do the same but set the counter to 1 or greater (the number of threads that may access the resource at once).

How do we prevent deadlock?
	Enforce an order on locks. 

What is polymorphism?
	It is the ability for a method to have different behavior depending on the type of object it is being called on or the type of object passed to it as a parameter. 

*Always consider data type overflow issues.

Disrupts the flow of cin and cout but really boosts performance. 
int x=[](){
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(nullptr);
    return 0;
}();
