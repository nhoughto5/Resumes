I am quite familiar with Unity 3D but have most of my graphics experience in C++ with OpenGL.
I recently made a simple 2D space shooter with Unity 5 and C\#.
A demo can be seen on my website.
%I am a quick learner and believe I would make a strong candidate for this position.

I worked closely with Dr. Brian Wyvill at the University of Victoria whose research is focused on animation.
We worked with C++, OpenGL 3, QT and the Boost library.
Since he taught me the 12 principles of animation, I see their application vividly. 
To gain experience with their effect I made a quick animation about a toaster.
Though it was short it was clear to me how their use can bring something so mundane as a toaster to life.
It inspired me to do anything I could to make animation the focus of my career.
C++ has always been my favorite programming language.
Combining it with the pipeline power of OpenGL and the potential is incredible.
Unlike most higher level languages I feel like I have a much better understanding of what the code is actually doing under the hood.
It is the language I have had the most formal training with; I was instructed in modern techniques and coding practices during a multi-resolution signal processing class during my masters.
This knowledge I have applied to each of my OpenGL projects.
I made a basic first person shooter game which I called 'Zombie Hunt'.
It involved basic animations using Blender, AI programming and game-engine mechanics. 
%This was my first introduction to inter-object mechanics, creating light-sources, computing gravity and so on.

During my studies with Dr. Wyvill I was introduced to more complex simulation techniques.
Using Lagrangian mechanics, quaternions and spline paths I created a globular physics simulation. 
I imported a fountain object and had it spray out droplets of a liquid.
These droplets were subject to attraction and repulsion forces.
Tweaking the values could modify the behavior to look like water, putty, even powder.
I have made videos demonstrating these projects, a URL to view them is available upon request.
