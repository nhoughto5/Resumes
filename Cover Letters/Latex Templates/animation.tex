I am a skilled C++ and developer with experience in animation, rendering and game development.
%I completed my undergrad with a specialty in embedded systems. 
%This gives me considerable more familiarity with hardware architectures, data structures and operating systems than most other developers.
%Additionally I completed a masters of applied science with a focus on hardware security during which I worked closely with multi-processor systems, embedded platform development, Java, and C++. 
%I am familiar with Unreal Engine 4, OpenGL and the DirectX API.
I have a serious passion for computer graphics and game engine design.
I have made several games and physical system animations in my own personal projects using OpenGL.
I am currently employed in Los Angeles at JibJab studios where I working in two man team responsible for the Render Library.
Using OpenGL and it's Javascript based alternate WebGL we develop and maintain the rendering technologies that make the entire JibJab product line possible. 

I am a Unity hobbyist and am currenlty working on two 3d projects, one a zombie-based first person shooter, the second, a third person RPG about a Koala.
Both are still in early development so I have not advertised them in my portfolio however I would love to give you a teaser if you are interested. 
I do however have a 2D game I made with Unity demonstrated on my website.
%I am familiar with developing for Unity 5 with C\# and am currently taking the Udemy Unreal Engine Developer Course (C++).
%This course has made me intimately familiar with the Unreal engine and its API.

%I feel it is also worth mentioning that I am both a Canadian and Irish citizen. 
%I am willing to relocate and my citizenship allows me to work in the UK. 

%I am quite familiar with Unity 3D but have most of my graphics experience in C++ with OpenGL.
%I recently made a simple 2D space shooter with Unity 5 and C\#.
%A demo can be seen on my website.
%I am a quick learner and believe I would make a strong candidate for this position.

%I worked closely with Dr. Brian Wyvill at the University of Victoria whose research is focused on animation.
%We worked with C++, OpenGL 3, QT and the Boost library.
%Since he taught me the 12 principles of animation, I see their application in both film and games.
%It is my ambition to become a part of this industry. 
%To gain experience with their effect I made a quick animation about a toaster.
%Though it was short it was clear to me how their use can bring something so mundane as a toaster to life.
%It inspired me to do anything I could to make animation the focus of my career.
%C++ has always been my favorite programming language.
%Combining it with the pipeline power of OpenGL and the potential is incredible.
%Unlike most higher level languages I feel like I have a much better understanding of what the code is actually doing under the hood.
%It is the language I have had the most formal training with; I was instructed in modern techniques and coding practices during a multi-resolution signal processing class during my masters.
%This knowledge I have applied to each of my OpenGL projects.
%I made a basic first person shooter game which I called 'Zombie Hunt'.
%It involved basic animations using Blender, AI programming and game-engine mechanics. 
%This was my first introduction to inter-object mechanics, creating light-sources, computing gravity and so on.
%During my masters I worked closely with Dr. Brian Wyvill at the University of Victoria whose research is focused on animation.

%During my time with Dr. Wyvill I was introduced to more complex simulation techniques.
%Using Lagrangian mechanics, quaternions and spline paths I created a globular physics simulation. 
%I imported a fountain object and had it spray out droplets of a liquid.
%These droplets were subject to attraction and repulsion forces.
%Tweaking the values could modify the behavior to look like water, putty, even powder.
%I have made videos demonstrating these projects which you can see on my website.

%I watched the 'Tobii in 3 minutes' video and I feel that my graphics skills, knowledge of hardware systems and personal abilities will really help Tobii innovate and grow
%Additionally I am currently completing an online course through the Udemy training website on the Unreal engine.
%This course contains over 50 hours of instruction and has made me extremely comfortable developing with the Unreal engine.
