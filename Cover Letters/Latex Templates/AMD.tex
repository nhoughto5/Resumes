I would like to apply for the OpenGL/Vulkan engineer position advertised on your website.
I am currently working as a graphics engineer for JibJab studios in Los Angeles California but am considering a move to my home country of Canada.

I have a passion for rendering and graphics. 
I have experience with OpenGL and am currently teaching myself Vulkan by developing a renderer from scratch.
I have also gained experience with low-level hardware development during my time as a lab instructor for the University of Victoria's embedded platform and ARM assembly programming course. 
I have considerable experience with C++, am comfortable with both Windows and Unix, have strong foundational knowledge of computer architecture and am proficient in both 2D and 3D mathematics.
