I am currently on the UFC Mobile team as a client engineer. I was previously with Fifa Mobile but am now getting to use both my client and rendering skills to help get the new UFC Mobile off the ground.

I was previously employed as a rendering engineer for JibJab bros studios where I was responsible for development of the OpenGL render library.
Through my work with JibJab and a series of personal projects I have developed skills which I feel would make me a strong candidate for this role.

I have developed my own Vulkan renderer which is part of a larger game engine project I call 'Neato'. The work in progress can be viewed on my github page at https://github.com/nhoughto5/NeatoVulkanRenderer.
I have also worked on several game and rendering personal projects in Unity, Unreal and OpenGL.

I have strong 2D and 3D math skills, low-level embedded platform development experience, algorithm design and scripting experience.
