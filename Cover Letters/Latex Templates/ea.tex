I would like to submit my application for the rendering engineer role advertised.

I am currently employed as a rendering engineer for JibJab bros studios where I am responsible for development of the OpenGL render library.
Through my work with JibJab and a series of personal projects I have developed skills which I feel would make me a strong candidate for this role.

I am currently teaching myself the Vulkan API by developing my own renderer and hope to include physics and game engine features in the future.
I have also worked on several game and rendering personal projects in Unity, Unreal and OpenGL.

I have strong 2D and 3D math skills, low-level embedded platform development experience, algorithm design skills and scripting experience.
