It took me a while to discover what I was passionate about.
During my undergrad I experimented with hardware design, penetration testing, cryptography and embedded platform programming.
None of these experiences really got me excited.
Then, during my masters, I took a signal processing class which gave me my first introduction to graphics.
Not only was the complexity exciting, the ability to actually see your work create something was enthralling.
I came late in my education to graphics and game development; the other students were overwhelmingly skilled and knowledgeable.
Since then I have been driven to learn more.
Tutorials, projects, experiments, textbooks, on-line dev teams, twitter... anything I could think of to learn more, I have pursued.

I am fortunate enough to currently work with a brilliant OpenGL developer at JibJab studios.
I have learned more than I ever could on my own from him but the application of our work is relatively restricted.
I wish to work for \company~because I want an opportunity to learn even more.

Though I am yet to work in a real game studio, I feel my OpenGL skills and experience will make me a strong candidate.
I have done many on-line courses and personal projects to boost my skills but nothing can compare to learning from some of the best.
This is why I want to work for \company.

%I am currently addicted to Sega's Total War: Atilla. 
%I am a fanatic for strategy games and the gameplay of this installment has overwhelmed me.
%Further, the performance of their engine has always astounded me. 
%An opportunity to find out how they made something capable of thousands of simultaneous battling AI is a dream of mine.
%I know that I could satisfy a lot of curiosities such as this at \company.
