I am currently employed at Ocean Networks Canada (ONC) where we develop and maintain one of the largest oceanic data ingestion systems in existence.
Using java, the ONC system acquires, processes and distributes over 200 terabytes of information per day.
I believe the skills I have developed working on this system will readily apply to 
I have a bachelors in computer engineering and a masters in applied science.
