I am currently employed at Ocean Networks Canada (ONC) where we develop and maintain one of the largest oceanic data ingestion systems in existence.
Using java, the ONC system acquires, processes and distributes over 200 terabytes of information per day.
I believe the skills I have developed working on this system will readily apply to projects at \company.
I am very familiar with development of large scale web systems, linux servers, performance testing with JUnit, and restful APIs.

I have a bachelors in computer engineering during which I completed the \textit{Networks, Security and Privacy} specialization.
I am very familiar with modern networking protocols and am practiced at penetration testing using Kali linux.
During my masters I developed an application which automatically detects trojan viruses in field programmable gate-arrays using Java. 
This tool is the first of its kind; developing it gave me considerable experience in self-driven research, working with cutting edge technologies, algorithm design and academic writing.
