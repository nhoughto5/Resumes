I have excellent personal skills.
I am an experienced researcher, a natural independent thinker, and a concise communicator.
%I believe that I will make a strong candidate for this position; I wish to help \company~create breathtaking games and visual experiences.
%I believe that I will make a strong candidate for this position; I wish to help \textit{Everywhere} become the most breathtaking gaming experience yet.
I believe that my abilities would fit well with the \role~role and that I would be a valuable asset to the \company~team.

%I would like to also add that I am citizen of Ireland and would not need any sponsorship to work in Europe. 
Thank you for your time and consideration.

%I am currently finishing my masters of applied science at the university of Victoria in which my focus has been hardware security which has included FPGA design and assembly programming. My current research focus, under Dr. Fayez Gebali, is the development of FPGA design security in the \textit{Xilinx} tool-chain.. I have worked as a teaching assistant and tutor for \textit{Uvic's} Computer Engineering 255: \textit{Computer Architecture} for which my responsibility was the instruction of students in assembly programming in embedded platforms. During my undergrad I studied hardware design using VHDL for which I worked on multiple designs including a COORDIC algorithm processor.
%
%In the final co-op position of my undergrad I worked as a research assistant at \textit{Uvic}. My responsibility was the software, 'proof-of-concept', implementation of a new homomorphic encryption algorithm. My implementation was built using C++ and the openMP API; testing was performed on the \textit{WestGrid} research computing network. During this time I gained viable experience in efficient coding practices and effective use of hardware resources which would prove invaluable to the firmware development team at \company. In addition I have also used C++ in combination with OpenGL to develop animations to simulate real-world physical systems. Graphics programming is a highly complex, resource demanding enterprise which has further honed my hardware oriented programming skills. I am very proficient in web development using C\#, Javascript, HTML and CSS. I am also very familiar with tools such as \textit{Git}, \LaTeX, performance profilers, and integrated development environments such as visual studio and eclipse

%I have always been amazed by the capacity of gaming networks to not only handle such a multitude of requests and data but to do so in such a streamlined manner that the user never notices. 
%As a developer at Ocean Networks Canada I have gained considerable experience working with Java and the Yahoo User-Interface (YUI) framework while creating powerful and intuitive web technologies.
%My skills have developed rapidly and I feel I will continue to thrive in an intermediate position.
%During my undergrad I worked as a lifeguard; more importantly, as an Aquatic Team Leader.
%In this position I was responsible for guiding my team, training new staff, working with patrons and interfacing with external staff.
%As an intermediate developer I feel I will be able to use this experience to effectively guide and work with the less experienced members of ONC's development team.
%By leading by example, I feel I can provide a positive and insightful work environment which will help senior developers get the best out of their teams.

%Using \textit{java} I developed a distributed system modeling an on-line stock exchange system. 
%The project was focused on scalability; the end result was a an efficient, reliable system capable of processing upwards of thirty-thousand transactions per second. 
%I am very familiar with most Internet protocols; using Kali Linux I have performed penetration testing and network defense on websites, servers and mobile devices. 
%Using the .NET framework, C\#, Javascript and HTML I developed a website which hosts an on-line suite of tools for hardware developers to analyze security risks in their integrated circuits. 
%The website uses the \textit{Entity} framework to communicate with a remote database to store user, application and statistical data. 
%This website is currently hosted on the \textit{Azure Cloud System}. 
%I am also very proficient with C++. I used it to build a 'proof-of-concept' software implementation of a new homomorphic encryption scheme I helped develop with my research group. 
%I have also used C++ in combination with OpenGL to develop animations to simulate real-world physical systems. 
%I have also designed multiple integrated circuits using VHDL. 
%I am also very familiar with tools such as \textit{Git}, \LaTeX, performance profilers, and integrated development environments such as visual studio and eclipse.

%I received my bachelor's in engineering, majoring in computer engineering in April of 2015 and will defend my master's thesis on December 2nd. 
%The development of exceptional software, requires more than just the knowledge of what your code can accomplish. 
%To truly excel a developer must understand what is happening 'under the hood' of their machine. 
%I chose to study computer engineering because I wanted to not only gain the skills of a professional software engineer but to use my understanding of the hardware to stand out as a team member. 
%I am a skilled, hard-working developer with experience and knowledge I feel that I can bring to aid \textit{\company} in providing premium service and satisfaction to its customers.  

%I am a skilled, hard-working developer with experience and knowledge I feel that I can bring to aid \textit{\company} in developing some of the most unique and advanced devices today. I learned the value of a team dynamic while working as a lifeguard and aquatic supervisor during my undergrad. I believe that this experience, my skill set, and my reliability would make me a valuable asset to the \textit{\company} team. 
%
%For this position I would hope to receive a salary in the range of $\$55,000 - \$65,000$ per year however I am very willing to negotiate. 


%I believe I will make the ideal candidate for this position for several reasons. 
%
%I have experience developing games with Unreal Engine 4. I am currently  completing the Unreal Engine Developer course on Udemy.com which contains over 200 hours of instruction which includes the completion of 3 full 3D games from beginning to end. Additionally I am creating a Disc-Golf 3d in my own time which makes extensive use of the WorldMap terrain generator, landscape painting and environment artwork. I currently do not have any demos of these projects on my website, I will post full videos once I have completed the course however I would love to make and send you some interim videos to show you my passion and skill!
%
%I want to note that I have minimal experience with Maya however I have used Blender extensively. Blender is virtually an identical program.
%
%I am extremely skilled in working in both team environments and self-driven atmospheres. I bring out the best in my team to get the job done!
