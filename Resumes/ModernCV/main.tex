%\cvitem{Supervisors}{Dr. Fayez Gebali, Dr. Samer Moein}
%\cvitem{Description}{
%	Electronics have become such a staple in modern life that we are just as affected by their vulnerabilities as they are.
%	Ensuring that the processors that control them are secure is paramount to our intellectual safety, our financial safety, our privacy, and even our personal safety.
%	The market for integrated circuits is steadily being consumed by a reconfigurable type of processor known as a field-programmable gate-array (FPGA).
%	The very features that make this type of device so successful also make them susceptible to attack.
%	FPGAs are reconfigured by software; this makes it easy for attackers to make modification.
%	Such modifications are known as hardware trojans.
%	There have been many techniques and strategies to ensure that these devices are free from trojans but few have taken advantage of the central feature of these devices.
%	The configuration Bitstream is the binary file which programs these devices.
%	By extracting and analyzing it, a much more accurate and efficient means of detecting trojans can be achieved.
%	This discussion presents a new methodology for exploiting the power of the configuration Bitstream to detect and described hardware trojans.
%	A software application is developed that automates this methodology.
